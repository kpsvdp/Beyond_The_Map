        "I flew to Paris early in the morning, carrying more dreams than luggage. As the plane touched down, excitement rushed through me, I didn’t wait, I went straight to the Eiffel Tower. The first moment I saw it, standing tall against the sky, my heart felt full in a way I can’t explain. It wasn’t just a landmark anymore; it felt like a dream finally taking shape.",
        "After leaving my luggage in the room, I walked through the streets of Paris toward the world’s largest museum—the Louvre. Each step felt unreal, as if I was walking inside a picture I had once only imagined. By night, the city transformed. On the river cruise, Paris glowed softly, and when the Eiffel Tower lit up, it felt magical quiet, powerful, unforgettable.",
        "That night was my birthday. There were no friends beside me, no family around, but as I stood in front of the Eiffel Tower cutting my cake, my eyes filled with tears. Not from sadness, but from a deep mix of emotions—pride, gratitude, loneliness, and happiness all at once. I realised how far I had come, how strong I had become, and how sometimes the most meaningful moments are the ones we experience alone. I smiled through the tears and truly lived that moment, fully and honestly. ",
        "The next two days passed with morning tours, long walks, and Paris slowly becoming part of me. And when it was time to return to the UK, I carried back more than memories—I carried a quiet strength, a birthday I would never forget, and a piece of Paris in my heart."

        "Brussels, the capital of Belgium, welcomed me with a completely different charm. Travelling through the city on a hop-on hop-off bus made it easy to absorb its character old buildings, historic squares, and streets that felt preserved in time. The architecture told stories of centuries past, standing proudly in every corner of the city.",
        "The food in Brussels felt warm and comforting, from rich flavours to sweet treats, each bite felt like part of the city’s identity. As evening arrived, the Christmas market at Grand Place lit up the heart of Brussels. Surrounded by festive lights, old buildings, and winter air, the city felt alive, joyful, and peaceful all at once.",
        "Brussels wasn’t rushed. It was calm, welcoming, and full of quiet beauty, the perfect contrast to Paris."
